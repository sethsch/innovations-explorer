# The Public Innovations Explorer
This project was developed and submitted by [Seth Schimmel](emailto:seth.schimmel@gmail.com) in Spring 2021 towards the capstone requirement for completion of the Masters of Science in Data Analysis and Visualization at the CUNY Graduate Center. 
The project was motivated by my professional experience with data mining and analytics development within a private philanthropic foundation, and inspired by computational research methods being applied in social science fields like economic geography, science studies, and bibliometrics.  
   
By making even a subset of government funded research more visible for a variety of analysts and a wider public, my hope is that the Public Innovations Explorer can foreground and provoke questions regarding the geography of knowledge production and how “innovation” is defined in relation to particular research agendas.  Rather than advancing one particular analysis, the Explorer—along with its repository of scripts and processed data—can contribute to a variety of analyses while also highlighting the ways in which data modeling, analytics and visualization go hand in hand.
