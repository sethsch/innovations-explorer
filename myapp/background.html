                        <p>
                            This project was developed and submitted towards the capstone requirement for completion of the Masters of Science in Data Analysis and Visualization at the CUNY Graduate Center.  The project was motivated by my professional experience with data mining and analytics development within a private philanthropic foundation, and inspired by recent research and scholarship in fields like computational social sciences, scientometrics and economic geography.  
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By making even a subset of government funded research more visible for a variety of analysts and a wider public, my hope is that the Public Innovations Explorer can foreground and provoke questions regarding the geography of knowledge production and how “innovation” is defined in relation to particular research agendas.  Rather than advancing one particular analysis, the Explorer—along with its repository of scripts and processed data—can contribute to a variety of analyses while also highlighting the ways in which data modeling, analytics and visualization go hand in hand. 
                        </p>

                       

                        <h4 class="examples-heading" id="list-item-1">Scientometrics</h4>
                        <p>
                            Researchers in bibliometrics develop statistical measures to evaluate the impact of publications, generating co-authorship and citation networks that make it possible to make content recommendations based on textual and network level information and to digitally trace genealogies of new ideas (Ganguly & Pudi, 2017; Satish et al., 2020; Vieira & Gomes, 2009).  As a sub-field of bibliometrics, scientometrics seeks to apply these quantitative techniques to publication outputs in order to describe phenomena such as: the historical or current dynamics of national and international scientific collaboration (Gui et al., 2019; J. Li et al., 2020; Newman, 2001; Stek & van Geenhuizen, 2016); the emergence of innovations in particular fields like materials science, topics like big data, or even particular technologies like flash memory or solid-state drives (Gläser & Laudel, 2015, 2015; Y. Li et al., 2018; Ranaei et al., 2019); to explain how publication and citation activity differs based on gender, and relates to career outcomes for scientists (King et al., 2017; Nosek et al., 2010; Parker et al., 2013).  Scientometrics has contributed techniques that are useful both for enhancing research monitoring and distribution platforms, and also for conducting sociological analyses of various dimensions of scientific practice.  Increasingly, though, there is also overlap between practitioners of scientometrics and others in fields like policy studies, economic geography and those conducing evaluations of funding programs.

                                While the linked data ecosystem has become more robust in recent years, the use of patent records as a proxy for measuring innovative activity is not new (Jaffe et al., 1993; Verbeek et al., 2004).  Recent scholarship in economic geography and science and technology policy studies uses patent data to describe comparative advantages and disadvantages between different geographic regions and to offer policy makers and analysts one way of understanding of how scientific and technical specialization might effect policy planning and outcomes (Apa et al., 2018; Balland et al., 2019; Boschma et al., 2014; Castaldi & Los, 2017; Perruchas et al., 2020; Surana et al., 2020; Wouden & Rigby, 2020).

                                My work intends to draw on and engage with scholars, analysts and funders for whom the work above is of interest.  While much has been done analyzing patent data, publications and citations as proxies for particular scientific outcomes or to develop regional comparisons, much less work has been done to analyze publicly available grants data  (Kardes et al., 2014; Talley et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2016) and to assess relationships between geographical specialization and funding flows (Chausse Vázquez de Parga, 2018).  This project adds to those handful of efforts that explicitly analyze funding data, using techniques from text mining and linked data to enrich data.  This work also takes inspiration from scholars in economic geography and spatial analysis by visualizing the data geographically alongside potentially related contextual indicators.

                                The choice to include labor statistics in an exploratory context was influenced by work on R&D knowledge spillovers that examine how proximity of innovative firms effects the overall spatial distribution of innovative activity and its associated economic effects (Anselin et al., 2000; Bonaccorsi & Daraio, 2005; Jaffe et al., 1993; Wallsten, 2001).  While Jaffe and Wallsten emphasized, in part, how the tacit, social and non-codified dimensions of knowledge sharing may thought of as the reason why like-minded researchers would tend to cluster, others have avoided such theories in favor of more political-economic theories dealing with labor market localization or even research subcontracting arrangements between universities and other firms.  Breschi and Francesco (2001), for instance, warned that spillovers of knowledge may not be unique simply because “knowledge” is supposedly a unique kind of product or service that depends on social transmission and collaboration, stating: “we suggest that spatial proximity of innovators, when found to be significant, may not depend upon any intrinsic feature of knowledge, such as its “tacitness” or “codification”, but on a much more complex interplay between those characteristics, the labour market for scientists and technologists” (3).  Following those whose work remarks on the localization of specific industries and meanwhile also aim to disaggregate findings of innovation spillovers or localizations across specific types of activities. (Anselin et al., 2000; Audretsch & Feldman, 1996; Boschma et al., 2014).  Identifying spatial clusters where employment in specific industries tends to be highest is a good first step for guiding inquiry into how labor market features affect the kinds of innovative activities that come out of particular regions.

                                    Central to this work is the peculiarity of the grant record as a type of data artifact.  
                                    While both scientific publications and patent records are communicative artifacts whose primary purpose is directly supported by its existence as a physical or digital record, a grant record is more so an administrative artifact whose form is of secondary importance to the underlying function—a financial exchange.  
                                    A scholarly publication is a work with communicative, archival and historical purpose, around which various social activities and institutions coordinate.  
                                    As an artifact, a patent serves many of the same purposes.  
                                    At the same time, patents’ legal function make it a proxy for property rights within commercial, technological and intellectual space.  
                                    Patents administer property rights, and reflect a series of inventions that might only be considered "innovations" with the benefit of hindsight.  
                                    
                                </p>

                                In the landscape of research and knowledge production, grant records are an <u><em>input</em></u> that reflect momentary opportunities and priorities.  
                                Highlighting the <em><u>what</u></em> and <em><u>where</u></em> of research funding is one way to evaluate which research initiatives and agendas have been prioritized in the past, and imagine what research initiatives and agendas might be supported in the future.
                                In order to advance these qualitative analyses, it is important to have consistent qualitative metadata regarding the subject matter of research activities that are funded.  
                                Typically, patent records and scientific publications are frequently utilized data sources within scientometric research.  While researchers frequently use natural language processing on abstracts or the body text of publications, crucially important is that these data sources often include carefully curated metadata.  Patent documents include a variety of industrial classifications, and publications include a host of subject area as well as geographic and historical classifications.  The relative consistency of the schemes makes for relatively clean analyses of co-occurence between classifications.  For scholars in fields like economic geography and scientometrics, the recombinations of thematic classifications or of authorial collaborations are interesting proxies for the recombinant social activities that develop and spread knowledge.

                                Over 80% of the 65,749 awards in the 2008 to 2018 SBIR/STTR grants dataset used for this project included information regarding the solicitations for proposals on the basis of which a grants was awarded, and over 90% included topic codes.  
                                However, in working with the SBIR.gov databases and doing my best to understand the chain of identifiers used for linking, I was only able to connect 52% of awards to their solicitation information and just 32% to their topic information.  
                                It did not appear to me that a single, direct unique identifier was available to cleanly connect award records to the solicitation and topic information. Additionally, across the grant records, just 43% came with Research Keywords.  
                                Rather than train a classifier to predict solicitation or topic codes whose linkages to qualitative information would be uncertain, I chose to enrich the data by extracting keywords from grant abstracts for all records.  
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                While the keywords supply qualitative information to the Explorer, this data can be used for a number of extended analyses.  Researchers in scientometrics or economic geography may be interested in analyses of novel terms across geographies and time, or in evaluating further whether the research topics funded in certain regions tended to vary according to the specialized labor profile of the region.  Alternatively, others interested in the curation and metadata standards may want to analyze the overlap between the vocabularies and keyword extraction methods that were utilized.  Both efforts could help to develop the more commonplace use grant records toward research on knowledge production.
