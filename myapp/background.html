                        <p>
                            This project was developed and submitted towards the capstone requirement for completion of the Masters of Science in Data Analysis and Visualization at the CUNY Graduate Center.  The project was motivated by my professional experience with data mining and analytics development within a private philanthropic foundation, and inspired by recent research and scholarship in fields like computational social sciences, scientometrics and economic geography.  
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            By making even a subset of government funded research more visible for a variety of analysts and a wider public, my hope is that the Public Innovations Explorer can foreground and provoke questions regarding the geography of knowledge production and how “innovation” is defined in relation to particular research agendas.  Rather than advancing one particular analysis, the Explorer—along with its repository of scripts and processed data—can contribute to a variety of analyses while also highlighting the ways in which data modeling, analytics and visualization go hand in hand. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Central to this work is the peculiarity of the grant record as a type of data artifact.  While both scientific publications and patent records are communicative artifacts whose primary purpose is directly supported by its existence as a physical or digital record, a grant record exists as an administrative artifact whose form as a data artifact is of secondary importance to its function as a financial exchange or transaction.  In the landscape of research and knowledge production, grant records are an input that reflect attractive opportunities and priorities.  Highlighting the <em><u>what</u></em> and <em><u>where</u></em> of research funding is one way to evaluate which research initiatives and agendas have been prioritized in the past, and imagine what research initiatives and agendas might be supported in the future.
                        </p>

                        <p>Use the explorer to retrieve district-level summaries regarding the research and technology transfer activities of small businesses,
                            or to identify different awardees and get a sense of their research agendas.  While you can always consult the central awards database at 
                            SBIR.gov to obtain more detail regarding individual grantees, the Public Innovations Explorer is intended to generate more locally-grounded 
                            portraits of specialized research activity. You might consider asking:

                                Select the Federal agencies and years of interest from the menus in the navigation bar above. You can explore the map to find companies, and details about grants they were awarded. Use the parallel coordinates plot to filter the congressional districts on the map, and identify hot spots and cold spots for different kinds of underlying economic activities. Click on a congressional district to see a summary of its funded research activities, labor profile and topics extracted from the funded research taking place there.
