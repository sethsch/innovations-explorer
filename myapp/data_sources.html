                            <p>The map panel displays congressional districts for the 116th United States Congress (2018).  You can choose how you would like to shade the map using the <strong>Congressional District Profiler</strong> menu.  The same color palette is always used on the map and the parallel coordinates profiler chart.</p>
                            <p>By default, or when you select “Employment sectors” from the dropdown menu, the map and profiler chart will display district-level employment statistics.  Use this data to navigate the map according to the economic landscape of the country.  Each line in the profiler chart reflects a district.  The level of employment in each sector is shown where the line passes through that sector’s axis.  For example, let’s say you would like to explore the following question:
                                <ul>

                                    <li> What research activities were funded in districts with a higher-than average proportion of workers in manufacturing sectors? </li>
                                    
                                </ul>
                            
                            </p>

                            <p>Click the MFCTR axis on the profiler chart to change the color palette from the default axis to the Manufacturing sectors.  The information bar and legend will be updated to provide some contextual information on manufacturing employment across the country.  You can either pan to the red and orange districts on the map, or select a portion of districts by using the brushes on the MFCTR axis of the profiler chart.  As you set a selection, the districts will highlight on the map.  You can even set multiple selections to narrow in on districts that meet multiple criteria, like: <em>districts with the largest science and management workforce among districts with high agricultural employment</em>, or, <em>districts with a large construction workforce AND transportation and utilities workforce</em>.
                            </p>
                            <p>To exclude districts that had NO grant recipients, use the toggle buttons next to the dropdown menu; this will gray-out non-funded districts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Alternatively, you can navigate the SBIR/STTR funding landscape by evaluating where particular Federal departments and agencies committed funding.  Select “Funding agencies” from the Congressional District Profiler menu to display total funding by each agency at the district-level.  Now, each line the chart represents a district’s total funding received from the given agency across the selected years.  The level of funding in the district from each agency is shown where the line intersects with that agency’s axis.  Use the same techniques described above to explore questions like:
                                <ul>

As you set a selection, the districts will highlight on the map.  You can even set multiple selections to narrow in on districts that meet multiple criteria, like: <em>districts with the largest science and management workforce among districts with high agricultural employment</em>, or, <em>districts with a large construction workforce AND transportation and utilities workforce</em>.

                            <p>To exclude districts that had NO grant recipients, use the toggle buttons next to the dropdown menu; this will gray-out non-funded districts.

                                Alternatively, you can navigate the SBIR/STTR funding landscape by evaluating where particular Federal departments and agencies committed funding.  Select “Funding agencies” from the Congressional District Profiler menu to display total funding by each agency at the district-level.  Now, each line the chart represents a district’s total funding received from the given agency across the selected years.  The level of funding in the district from each agency is shown where the line intersects with that agency’s axis.  Use the same techniques described above to explore questions like:

                                <li>What districts received the most SBIR/STTR funding across all agencies?</li>
                                <li>What districts received the most SBIR/STTR funding from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)?  From the Department of Transportation?</li>
                                
                                </ul>
